1. Intended Use
- Primary intended use cases:
  - Generate concise, classroom-friendly explanations and short practice questions from user-provided lesson outlines.
  - Assist course authors in drafting micro-lessons and learning objectives.
- Out-of-scope:
  - Medical, legal, or mental-health diagnosis/advice.
  - High-stakes decision making.
- Stakeholders & approvers: Product: Beni Badibanga; ML owner: @Digital77777; Safety reviewer: TBD.

2. Model Details
- Framework & libs: PyTorch 2.2, transformers 4.35, PEFT for prefix tuning.
- Architecture: Decoder-only transformer, 7B params, 32 layers, rotary embeddings.
- Training compute: 8x A100-80GB, ~36 GPU-hours (fine-tune); base pretraining not included.
- Model size: 7,073,000,000 params
- Checkpoint location: registry://snapbuilder/models/snapbuilder-user-demo-2025-09-15:v1.0

3. Training Data
- Datasets used:
  - curated-edu-texts-2024-snap-v1 — 120M tokens — licensed CC-BY where available.
  - synthetic-qa-aug-2025 — 15M tokens — generated by controlled templating.
- Data provenance & collection windows:
  - Primary scraped sources: open educational resources 2018–2024; internal author drafts 2024–2025.
- Preprocessing:
  - HTML cleaning, dedupe at document-level, sentence tokenization, 1.5% manual QA sampling.
- Sensitive data handling:
  - PII scan run with regex and ML-based detectors; any hits redacted before training.

4. Evaluation
- Eval datasets:
  - snapbuilder-eval-v1 (manual rubric annotations, 2k items)
  - truthset-curriculum-2024
- Metrics:
  - BLEU: baseline 18.2 -> this model 24.7
  - Human rubric accuracy (usefulness/comprehensibility): baseline 62% -> this model 84%
  - Hallucination rate (annotated): 12% typical -> measured 6% after safety-filter
- Known failure modes:
  - Overconfident incorrect facts on specialized niche topics.
  - Tendency to abbreviate technical nuance when generating short outputs.
- Calibration:
  - Uses token-level temperature 0.8 in prod; includes confidence score via calibrated head.

5. Safety, Bias & Ethics
- Safety mitigations:
  - Post-generation classifier to block disallowed content categories (violence, hate, illicit instructions).
  - Refusal policy for medical/legal prompts; triggers human-review workflow.
- Bias assessment:
  - Evaluated on demographic prompt sets — small tendency to favor Western English examples; mitigation: augmentation with non-Western datasets planned.
- Monitoring:
  - Drift detection for input token distribution; daily review of moderation flags.

6. Deployment & Monitoring
- Serving endpoint: https://api.internal/snapbuilder/v1/models/snapbuilder-user-demo-2025-09-15
- Inference spec:
  - CPU fallback, GPU instances: g4dn.xlarge for low-latency test; autoscaling on GPU fleet for production heavy loads.
- Expected latency / throughput:
  - Target: p95 <= 250ms for 512-token requests at 10 QPS baseline.
- Monitoring & alerts:
  - Collected metrics: request latency, error rate (5xx), moderation flags, hallucination proxy (failed fact-checks), input distribution drift.
  - Dashboards: Grafana/SnapBuilder > Model > snapbuilder-user-demo-2025-09-15
- Rollout strategy:
  - Canary: 5% traffic for 48 hours; monitor key metrics; escalate or rollback if thresholds breached.

7. Reproducibility
- Training config: configs/snapbuilder/v1_finetune.yaml (commit: 8a19e9e)
- Random seeds: 42, 2025
- Artifacts to reproduce:
  - dataset snapshots: curated-edu-texts-2024-snap-v1 (registry snapshot id)
  - code commit: 8a19e9ee470f3cab568d195844f5eef72bbe91ee
  - environment: environment.yml (PyTorch 2.2, CUDA 12.x)
- Repro steps: see scripts/reproduce_snapbuilder_model.sh

8. Maintenance & Lifecycle
- Retrain triggers:
  - When monitored hallucination proxy or human-quality score falls >10% from baseline for 2 weeks, or significant dataset drift detected.
- Owner & SLA:
  - On-call: @Digital77777; SLO: availability 99.5%; latency p95 <=250ms.
- End-of-life:
  - Archive checkpoint to registry/archive and remove production routing after stakeholder signoff.

9. Audit & Compliance
- Privacy review: partial; PII redaction pipeline documented in privacy/reports/snapbuilder_pii_review.md
- Security review: dependencies scanned weekly; infra isolated in VPC.
- Regulatory: Not intended for regulated domains; GDPR data subjects removal pipeline available.
