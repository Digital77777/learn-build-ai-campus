# MODEL_CARD — PromptPlayground — prompt-playground-defaults-2025-09

- Model name(s): openai/gpt-4o-preview (primary), local-fine-tune-3B (fallback)
- Version / id: provider-managed / local-fine-tune:v0.9
- Short description: Configuration and documentation for PromptPlayground usage: default provider models, parameter presets, and guidance for publishing any fine-tuned artifacts.
- Owner / contact: Beni Badibanga (@Digital77777) — info.dim77@gmail.com
- Created on: 2025-09-15
- License: Provider terms apply for hosted models; Apache-2.0 for any local artifacts.

1. Intended Use
- Primary intended use:
  - Rapid prompt experimentation, A/B testing prompt variants, and prototyping content generation workflows.
- Out-of-scope:
  - Publishing high-risk or regulated-scope content (medical/legal) without safety review.
- Stakeholders & approvers: Product: @Digital77777; Security: TBD.

2. Model Details
- Providers & models:
  - openai/gpt-4o-preview — default provider model for experiments.
  - local-fine-tune-3B — small local fine-tune used for offline testing (PyTorch, 3B params).
- Default prompt parameters:
  - temperature: 0.7
  - top_p: 0.95
  - max_tokens: 512
  - stop sequence: ["###"]
- Fine-tuned artifacts: if published, add full MODEL_CARD in docs/models/prompt-playground/<artifact>/

3. Training Data (local artifacts only)
- For any local fine-tunes: document dataset snapshots, provenance, and licence per artifact.
- Example: local-fine-tune-3B used curated-dialogues-2024 (snapshot id: cp-2024-09-01).

4. Evaluation
- Evaluation approach:
  - A/B compare prompt variants via human ratings for relevance, factuality, and safety.
  - Automated metrics: ROUGE/BLEU for templated outputs; hallucination proxy via fact-checker recall.
- Known failure modes:
  - Inconsistent behavior when prompts rely on implicit context; cost spikes on unbounded token generation.

5. Safety, Bias & Ethics
- Safety guardrails:
  - Provider moderation enabled by default.
  - Runtime prompt sanitization to remove PII before sending to external providers (configurable).
- Bias assessment:
  - Periodic synthetic prompt tests to detect harmful completions; log and review flagged outputs.

6. Deployment & Monitoring
- Invocation endpoints:
  - Provider APIs (OpenAI) or local inference endpoint (if fine-tuned deployed).
- Monitoring:
  - Track request volume, cost per 1k tokens, moderation flag percentage, and latency.
- Cost controls:
  - Per-user monthly quota; throttle non-admin users at 100k tokens/day by default.

7. Reproducibility
- Save prompt templates, system messages, and parameter presets in repo under prompt-presets/.
- For fine-tunes, include training commit SHA and dataset snapshot IDs.

8. Maintenance & Lifecycle
- Owner & SLA:
  - On-call: @Digital77777
  - Quota and cost usage reviewed weekly.
- Deprovisioning:
  - Revoke provider keys when retiring environment; archive prompt sets and experiment logs.

9. Audit & Compliance
- Provider TOS and data handling must be followed.
- Keep a log of prompts sent to external providers for 30 days for auditing.
